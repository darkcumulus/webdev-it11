# HTML id Attribute

The HTML `id` attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.

You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.



## Using The id Attribute

The `id` attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the `id` attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The `id` attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.

In the following example we have an `<h1>` element that points to the id name "myHeader". This `<h1>` element will be styled according to the `#myHeader` style definition in the head section:

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

</body>
</html>
```

**Note:** The id name is case sensitive!

**Note:** The id name must contain at least one character, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.).



## Difference Between Class and ID

A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:

Example:

```html
<style>
/* Style the element with the id "myHeader" */
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Style all elements with the class name "city" */
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>

<!-- An element with a unique id -->
<h1 id="myHeader">My Cities</h1>

<!-- Multiple elements with same class -->
<h2 class="city">London</h2>
<p>London is the capital of England.</p>

<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
```

## HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links

HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.

Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.

To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it.

Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

Example:

First, create a bookmark with the `id` attribute:

```html
<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
```

Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:

```html
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
```

Or, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from another page:

```html
<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
```



## Using The id Attribute in JavaScript

The `id` attribute can also be used by JavaScript to perform some tasks for that specific element.

JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the `getElementById()` method:

### Example

Use the `id` attribute to manipulate text with JavaScript:

```html
<script>
function displayResult() {
  document.getElementById("myHeader").innerHTML = "Have a nice day!";
}
</script>
```
